_________________________________________________________________________

2. Explain the difference between absolute and relative positioning 

Solution : 

A.) Relative Positioning:

i> Moves from Normal Flow: Element shifts from its normal position but stays in the document flow.

ii> Reference Point: Positioned relative to its normal position or closest positioned ancestor.

iii> Impact on Other Elements: Other elements are not affected; space is reserved.

B.) Absolute Positioning:

i>Removed from Flow: Element is taken out of the document flow, leaving no space.

ii> Reference Point: Positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor or initial containing block.

iii> Overlapping Possible: Can overlap other elements, controlled by z-index.
